# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Completed comprehensive image optimization across the entire site
- Integrated pre-optimized images with fallback to Netlify transformations
- Enhanced performance for both desktop and mobile browsing

## Recent Changes
- **Image Optimization Integration**: Connected the pre-optimized image system to all pages
- **Index Page Optimization**: Replaced Netlify parameters with image optimizer for featured images
- **Portfolio Page Integration**: Already using optimized images via image optimizer
- **Conventions Page Optimization**: Added image optimization to all dynamically generated images
- **Smart Path Matching**: Improved image optimizer to match paths between optimization manifest and web URLs
- **Format Detection**: Automatic AVIF/WebP format selection based on browser support
- **Responsive Sizing**: Proper size selection from pre-optimized variants

## Next Steps
1. Test the optimized images on live site to verify performance improvements
2. Monitor loading times and user experience on mobile devices
3. Consider running the build-time optimizer to generate missing optimized versions
4. Implement AI visual search functionality
5. Add color palette extraction from images
6. Test clean URLs on live site

## Considerations
- **Performance vs Quality**: Successfully balanced with optimized AVIF/WebP formats
- **Browser Compatibility**: Fallback system ensures compatibility with older browsers
- **Path Normalization**: Handled Windows vs web path differences in optimization manifest
- **Dynamic Content**: All dynamically generated images now use optimization
- **Scalability**: System ready for additional images as collection grows
